# AI-Powered Pakistani News Anchor
**Platform:** Hugging Face Spaces
**Technologies:** Streamlit, LLM APIs, Wav2Lip, OpenCV, TTS, RSS feed aggregation
**Languages:** Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS

Developed an innovative AI news anchor system that automatically transforms Pakistani news articles into professional video presentations. The system aggregates news from multiple RSS feeds in both English and Urdu, processes content using advanced LLMs for cleaning and summarization, generates natural-sounding synthetic voice narration with multiple TTS engines, and creates AI-powered video presentations with lip-synced avatars using Wav2Lip technology.

Key features include multi-language support, real-time processing with facial animation, comprehensive error handling, advanced caching mechanisms, and async processing for optimal performance. Built as a production-ready application on Hugging Face Spaces, demonstrating expertise in multimodal AI integration, real-time media processing, and scalable web application development. The project showcases technical proficiency in computer vision, natural language processing, and full-stack development with modern AI technologies.

**Technical Stack:** Streamlit, Python, OpenCV, Wav2Lip, Edge TTS, gTTS, Hugging Face Transformers, RSS feed parsing, LLM APIs (Groq, Together.ai, Cerebras), Async processing, Docker deployment
